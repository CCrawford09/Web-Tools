    <h1>Greetings Everyone!</h1>
    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>I am Cameron Crawford, an aspiring computer programmer and actor. I recently graduated from David W Carter High School and turned 19 earlier this year. I am a freshman and have multiple goals I hope to accomplish in the future. This class will help lead me to them. One day, I want to create and code my own computers, phones, video games, and many other types of technolgy. What got me into coding was the fascination and phenomenon behind computers and what programs command them. I remember wacthing a show called Ready Jet Go! It was a scientific kid show and one particular episode talked about 1's and 0's. It captivated me and lead to my interest in computer languages and programming.</p>
